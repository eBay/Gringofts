# Introduction

Gringofts makes it easy to build a replicated, fault-tolerant, high throughput and distributed event-sourced system. 
This type of system can process and store critical transaction data which is valuable for an entity.

Industries and typical applications that can benefit from Gringofts (but not limited to):
- Finance - Payment processing system
- Government - Civic Engagement system
- Healthcare - Electronic medical records (EMR) software
- Retail - Orders and sales management system
- Transport - Logistics and order management system
- ...

# Features

## Dependable Data
1. Data is highly available<br/>
Gringofts enables data to be stored in multiple replicas across data centers. 
Different deployment models are supported to achieve various levels of availability. 
For example, in a typical 2-2-1 setup (two replicas in each of the first two data centers and one replica in the third) 
data is still available even if two data centers are down.

1. Data is bit-level accurate across all replicas<br/>
Whichever replica you access, you get the exact same data. 
This is a top requirement for some applications such as a payment processing system, 
where each transaction must be accurately recorded.

1. Data is secure and tamper-proof<br/>
Industry-tested and accepted standards are used to encrypt the data 
and a blockchain-like technology is applied to avoid data being changed.

## High Throughput
Internal experiments show that a single cluster with a 2-1 setup (three replicas across two data centers) can process 8,000 transactions per second. 
Since the framework is designed to be linear-scalable, throughput can be increased with the increase of clusters. Below is a test result of a 667-cluster setup.

## Full Audit-ability
This is another must-have feature in most critical enterprise systems. 
Every write operation to a Gringofts-powered application is persisted by default and is immutable. 
A comprehensive toolset is also available to access this type of information.

## Easy to Use
Gringofts users are usually domain experts. They only need to focus on two things which they are very good at and Gringofts will take care of the rest:
1. Domain model<br/>
This defines objects required to solve the target business problem. For example, in an Order Management system, Order is a domain object.
2. Domain object interaction</br>
This defines how domain objects interact with each other. 
The interaction is usually modeled as two special objects called Command and Event, 
for example PlaceOrderCommand and OrderPlacedEvent.

## 100% State Reproducibility
Application state at any point of time in history is reproducible. 
This feature is especially useful when an application recovers after a crash or if users want to debug an issue.

# Get Started

## Supported Platforms
Currently, the recommended platforms are Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS 15.4.1. We plan to support more platforms in the near future.

## Set up Source Dependencies
```bash
bash ./scripts/addSubmodules.sh
```

## Build
### Build via Docker (Recommended)
This approach requires minimum dependencies on the target OS as all of the dependencies are encapsulated in a docker image.
1. Build docker image for compiling the project (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   sudo docker build --rm -t gringofts/dependencies:v3 -f dockers/dependencies/download.Dockerfile .
   sudo docker build --rm -t gringofts/compile:v3 -f dockers/dependencies/install.Dockerfile .
   ```
1. Build binaries
   ```bash
   sudo docker run --workdir "$(pwd)" --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target="$(pwd)" --user "$(id -u)":"$(id -g)" gringofts/compile:v3 hooks/pre-commit
   ```

### Build directly on local OS
1. Install external dependencies (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./scripts/setupDevEnvironment.sh
   ```
1. Build binaries
   ```bash
   hooks/pre-commit-build
   ```

## Run Demo App
1. Backed by a single-cluster setup
   ```bash
   examples/run_demo_backed_by_single_cluster.sh
   ```
   You can use [grpc_cli](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server_reflection_tutorial.md#list-services) to verify:
   ```bash
   ./grpc_cli call 0.0.0.0:50055 ringofts.demo.protos.DemoService.Execute "value:1"
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```bash
   connecting to 0.0.0.0:50055
   code: 200
   message: "Success"

   Rpc succeeded with OK status
   ```
3. Backed by a three-nodes-cluster setup
   ```bash
   examples/run_demo_backed_by_three_nodes_cluster.sh
   ```
4. Backed by SQLite3
   ```bash
   examples/run_demo_backed_by_sqlite.sh
   ```
