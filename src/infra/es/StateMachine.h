  /**
   * Apply an event to the state machine, whose internal state may or may not
   * be updated.
   *
   * Determinism must be guaranteed by any sub class implementing
   * this function, i.e., if State_A + Event_1 -> State_B, then no matter
   * how many times this function is invoked, given State_A and Event_1,
   * the result state must always be State_B.
   * In other words, randomness is not allowed in this function.
   *
   * However, note that idempotency is not mandatory.
   * For example, suppose the logic is send notification when Event_1 happens,
   * depending on the business requirement, sub class can choose to send the
   * notification only once no matter how many times Event_1 is applied or
   * multiple times.
   *
   * Discussion #1: Can this function create more events?
   * In reality, it's quite common sense that one event can trigger more events
   * (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). However in current
   * design we choose a simplified model, as illustrated below:
   *
   *     Command -----(process)-----> Events -----(apply)-----> State
   *        ^                                                     |
   *        |_____________________________________________________|
   *
   * This model can satisfy most use scenarios and most importantly, it gives us
   * below advantages:
   * 1. 100% reproducibility, which is not possible in real world but
   * super critical for computer systems.
   * 2. Simplified programming model and architecture.
   *
   * So unless we can be convinced by a real use scenario which cannot be
   * handled in the current model, and it's deterministic that Event_1 always
   * leads to Event_2, we will not add extra (potentially large) effort now to
   * carefully handle the complexity introduced to meet 100% reproducibility.
   *
   * @param event an #gringofts::Event object to be applied
   * @return the state machine with the latest state
